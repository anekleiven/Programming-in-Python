#Values of boolean expressions

C = 41 #creates a new varible C 
C == 40 #checks if C has the value 40. output true or false 
C != 40 or C < 41 #checks if C is not equal to or less than 41 
C != 40 and C < 41 #checks if C is not equal to and less than 41 
not C == 40 #checks if C is not equal to 40 -> true
not C > 40 #checks if C is not bigger than 40 -> false 
C <= 40 #checks if C is smaller than or equal to 40 
not False #is true 
True and False #evaluates to false 
False or True #evaluates to true 
False or True or False #evaluates to true since on of them is true 
True and True and False #evaluates to false 
False == 0  #checks if the value of False is zero -> true 
True == 0 #checks if the value of true is zero -> false 
True == 1 #checks if the value of true is 1 -> true
